name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and deploys
# the interactive system design platform to GitHub Pages.
# It runs whenever the main branch is updated.  If you prefer
# to use GitHub Pages directly (by enabling Pages in repository settings
# and serving from the root or a docs/ folder), you can disable
# this workflow.
